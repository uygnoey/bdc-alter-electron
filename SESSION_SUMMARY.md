# Session Summary - BMW Driving Center Reservation System Refactoring

## Date: 2025-08-21

## Major Refactoring and Improvements

### 1. Login Flow Optimization
- Changed approach to directly access schedule page (https://driving-center.bmw.co.kr/orders/programs/schedules/view)
- Implemented automatic OAuth login detection when redirected to login page
- Fixed password page login button clicking issue
- Added automatic navigation to schedule page after successful login

### 2. Program Parsing Enhancement
- Implemented direct parsing from useAmount/view page without login requirement
- Added proper rowspan handling for multi-row programs (e.g., Taxi program)
- Implemented Junior Campus filtering by excluding chargeCont2 DOM area
- Added support for Test Drive and Off-Road categories
- Removed hardcoded program lists - now dynamically parsed from page

### 3. Data Structure Simplification
- Converted programs from object array (with id, name, category) to simple string array
- Removed unnecessary ID generation and category fields
- Simplified React component state management
- Updated localStorage handling for backward compatibility

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Removed unnecessary program parsing during monitoring initialization
- Separated program fetching from monitoring start logic
- Monitoring now only performs login and goes directly to reservation checking
- Improved temporary BrowserView handling for program fetching

### 5. Error Handling Improvements
- Added proper ERR_ABORTED error handling during page redirects
- Implemented try-catch blocks in JavaScript execution
- Fixed React rendering errors with object children
- Improved error messages and status updates

### 6. Bug Fixes Completed
- Fixed: Login button not being clicked on password input page
- Fixed: Programs not displaying in UI despite successful parsing
- Fixed: ERR_ABORTED errors appearing in UI during redirects
- Fixed: Incorrect program parsing from wrong page
- Fixed: React error "Objects are not valid as a React child"
- Fixed: SolveCaptcha API integration issues

### 7. Code Quality Improvements
- Removed all hardcoded program lists
- Improved TypeScript type definitions
- Better separation between main and renderer processes
- Cleaner IPC communication patterns
- Removed unused code and dependencies

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `electron/main/browser-automation.js` - Complete rewrite of automation logic
- `electron/main/index.js` - Removed automatic page loading on startup
- `electron/main/solvecaptcha-wrapper.js` - Fixed export issues
- `electron/preload/index.js` - Added new IPC methods
- `src/components/BMWReservationPanel.tsx` - Simplified data handling
- `src/components/ElectronBrowser.tsx` - UI improvements
- `src/types/electron.d.ts` - Updated type definitions

### Key Changes in Approach
1. Direct schedule page access instead of main page navigation
2. Login only when required (detected by URL redirect)
3. Program parsing separated from monitoring flow
4. Simplified data structures throughout the application

## Current System State
- Successfully parses ~21 programs from BMW Driving Center
- Filters out Junior Campus programs correctly
- Handles rowspan in program tables
- Monitors selected programs for availability
- Automatically logs in when session expires
